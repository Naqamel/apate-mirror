A Proof of Concept Program that you can talk to, and it will talk back. Works best with headphones. 

You will need to download a VOSK engine from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/ in order for this to work. In my testing, this usually requires a minimum of 16 GB of RAM, but VOSK works very, very well. 
The Initial AI is Eliza, which does not do any machine learning, but evaluates text very fast and gives a fast response. It can be configured and customized with a JSON file. 
The Text to Speech is handled by the Microsoft desktop voices. 

This is a proof of concept application to determine if writing an AI to troll and prank call scammers was viable.  I wrote this in early 2021, and releasing is now as most of the functionality has been replaced by a new application currently dubbed "Project Brittany" which has a much better sounding voice(s), and specific moods modeled in a finite state machine.
